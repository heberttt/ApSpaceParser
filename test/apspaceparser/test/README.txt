- If a ta intake changes, change the json file
- This will calculate schedule based on their apspace (includes optional modules that they dont have)
- If a ta have class right before the shift, the shift will not be included in fear of class delay(ex: i have class at 1:30-2:30, the shift at 2:30-3:30 will not be included)
- If there are more than 1 group in their intake, it will calculate all the timetables of all groups.


hr:
Type "hr" when prompt "Custom (Enter if not): " appears
- This will show you all the available TAs on that specific shift

Typing "hr_desperate" when prompt "Custom (Enter if not) : " appears will remove the "If a ta have class right before the shift, the shift will not be included in fear of class delay(ex: i have class at 1:30-2:30, the shift at 2:30-3:30 will not be included)" condition
